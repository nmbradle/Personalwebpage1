		<h2>About</h2>
				<img src="images/About1.jpeg">
				<p>My name is Natalie Bradley. I am studying for my Bachelor of Arts in Art with a concentration in Graphic Design at Millersville University. I am also graduating in the Spring of 2024!
				</p>
				 <h2>Other Interests</h2>

				<p>I am a flyer on the Millersville Cheerleading team. In the beginning of January 2024, we competed at UCA College Nationals where our team placed 9th in the nation out of 38 teams! This Spring I am attending the Baltimore Ravens prep clinic in hopes of trying out for their coed stunt team.

				In my designs, I primarily work in Adobe Illustrator. I enjoy creating unique branding packages that include logos, storefronts, merchandise, website layouts, and other design materials.
